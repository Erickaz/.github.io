    “The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas” - Response, Eric Kaszycki
  </h1>
  <p>
   <ul>
    <strong> <li>Within the work "The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas", there's a strong issues put forth of what discrimination is required for a society, the 
     people of Omelas, to insure happiness.</li> </strong>
    <li>The child's suffering cannot be changed otherwise the current happiness will disappear. Do some people have to remain in poverty, saddness, and dispare?</li>
    <li>The author assembles the idea that even if the child were free it had already been afraid to long to feel happiness; so no one will ever care to help.</li>
    <li>People from Omelas are not unaware or unwilling, they are directly shown the evil that allows the society</li>
    <li>The people who leave Omelas walk to nowhere, to darkness, a place unimaginable. Is this where there really is no discrimination? Something no society has seen?</li>
